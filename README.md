# AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Machine Learning Foundamentals

Here are projects for AWS-Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Machine Learning Foundamentals. 

## Project 1 Overview
This project involves using AWS SageMaker and the AutoGluon library to build a forecasting model for the [Bike Sharing Demand Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). The project includes the construction of three distinct models using AutoGluon, with predictions submitted to Kaggle for evaluation:
1. Model using raw features
2. Model with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
3. Model with hyperparameter tuning
    
I have provided a report on exploratory data analysis and reflections on the experiments conducted throughout the project.

**Project Description and Templates**: [github](git@github.com:udacity/nd009t-c1-intro-to-ml-project-starter.git)

**Skills**: Explorative Data Anlaysis, Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement ML, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Random Forest, XGBoost, AutoGluon, AWS SageMaker
